# ART-BY-AI
Convert your photo to cartoon photo with 4 different designs with a few lines of code (python)


In the past sketching or creating a cartoon need to be done by hand. Nowadays, many applications can turn your photos to cartoons or to art. this kind of photo is common recently on social networking sites and around the world. But what if I told you, that you can create your own effect with just a few lines of code? Using the Convolutional Neural Network and the U-Net model, in this project, we will be able to produce 4 types images


So ART BY AI is a CNN model (Convolutional neural networks ) which is kind of deep learning model for image processing,it is a mathematical construct that usually consists of three types of layers convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. The first two layers, convolution and pooling layers, extract features, and the third layer maps the extracted features into the final output, such as classification.


Convolutional neural networks gave good results on simpler image segmentation problems but did not make any good progress on complex problems. This is where UNet comes into the picture. UNet was first designed specifically for medical image segmentation. It showed good results, which I then used in many other fields.

The code was attatched as a Jupyter Notebook , enjoy your journey!
